1.What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?
I should have decided on a consistent error handling strategy before coding and created test cases to define expected behavior before diving into coding.

2.Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?
 The process of deducting points for late submissions was complex because it required precise date comparisons and conditional adjustments to scores.

3.What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?
 Providing  more specific error messages and user feedback.

4.Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again:
I should always design with flexibility in mind. Avoid hard-coded data  and onâ€™t be afraid to rewrite parts of the program if you identify cleaner or more efficient ways to do things.
